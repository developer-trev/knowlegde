## Github Actions to Deploy to AWS S3 Bucket

Yes, you can absolutely use GitHub Actions to deploy files to an Amazon S3 bucket. This is a common use case, especially for deploying static websites or build artifacts. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how you can do it:

âœ… Prerequisites
An AWS S3 bucket created.

AWS access credentials (AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) with permissions to upload to the bucket.

Secrets set up in GitHub:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

You can add these secrets in your repository under:
Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions â†’ New repository secret

ðŸ§± Example GitHub Actions Workflow
Here's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow that syncs files to S3:

```
# .github/workflows/deploy-to-s3.yml
name: Deploy to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or your deployment branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-east-1  # change as needed

    - name: Sync files to S3
      run: |
        aws s3 sync ./dist s3://your-bucket-name --delete

```

- ./dist should be the path to your build/output directory.
- The --delete flag ensures that files deleted locally are also removed from the S3 bucket.

ðŸ”’ IAM Permissions Needed
Make sure the IAM user or role used in the GitHub secrets has at least the following permissions:

## Github Actions in a Mono Repo

How GitHub Actions Works in a Monorepo
GitHub Actions runs workflows based on events (like push, pull_request, etc.), but you can target specific folders or files using the paths or paths-ignore filters. This is ideal for monorepos.

ðŸ”§ Example: Run Only When a Subdirectory Changes
Suppose you have this monorepo structure:

```
/my-monorepo
  /frontend
  /backend
  /shared
```

You can trigger workflows only when something in frontend/ changes:
```
# .github/workflows/frontend-deploy.yml
name: Frontend Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'frontend/**'

jobs:
  deploy-frontend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build and Deploy Frontend
        run: |
          cd frontend
          npm install
          npm run build
          # deploy steps...
```

Similarly, a separate workflow can handle backend/** changes.

ðŸ§  Tips for Monorepos + GitHub Actions
- Use paths to isolate workflow triggers per project.
- Use matrix builds if you want to run the same logic across multiple directories.
- Modularize workflows using reusable workflows.
- Cache dependencies per project using key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }} or similar logic scoped to subfolders.
